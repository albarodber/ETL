- Airbnb: Final practice of the subject in which all the phases of an ETL project are carried out. 

    First, the connection to the database is made. Then, different transformations are made to obtain the required data. Finally, the new tables are loaded into the database. 
    
    The database corresponds to accommodations on the Airbnb website.
